### 1. Purpose and Objectives

*   Collaborate with Greenwich to do exploratory analysis and visualize the labour market data last year by creating Tableau dashboard.
*   Conduct the geospatial visualize of the job opportunities and salary level of US Labor market based on the Greenwich database. 
*   Find out the spatial correlation between job count, salary, and CPI.   
*   Find out the correlation between the skills and salarys.



### 2. Dataset

*   Location data: zip code, address, long/lat
*   Time series: time to post, time to fill
*   Categories: Company, role, tags
*   Response: salary
*   External data: 
    1.  CPI by city
    2.  Population density by zip code

### 3. Data Cleansing

*   Remove NA first (how to impute the NA): long and lat are missing, impute them by city locations (city and state). 
*   Merge three tables based on job-id
*   One job id has different observations with different salary and different locations (average salary, and remain the location and         rows)
*   Reduce the data redundancy


### 4. EDA

*   Summary the response variable: charts (density functions), monthly data, scatter plot
*   Heatmap (nation wise) (city wise: Chicago, NYC, LA)

### 5. Sanity check

*   One job id has several locations
*   Job from NY CITY, some zipcodes are not in NY. 

### 5. Tools

*   Tableau
*   Spatial Analysis(GIS)
*   Shinny dashboard

### 6. Business Impacts

*   Understand the US labor market, 
*   Recommend recruiting strategy to company. 
*   Help job seeker land best job
*   Help Greenwhich.hr find the data mistake from their database
