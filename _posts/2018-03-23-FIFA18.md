### 1. Business Problem

*   Implicit to rate player overall performance
*   Teams suffer losses when underestimate player value  
*   Negotiation is unnecessarily long to determine player value  


### 2. Purpose and Objectives

Predict soccer player’s value by using predictive models based on the features including base stats, skills, preferred position, and club, etc to assist club manager to gain negotiation power in the transfer market, offer wise transfer fee and wage, and ultimately benefit the club from the deal.

*   **Vision**: Assist club manager to gain negotiation power in the transfer market, offer wise transfer fee and wage, and ultimately benefit the club from the deal.
*   **Mission**: Predict player’s value, wage, and overall rating by using predictive models based on the features including base stats, skills, preferred position, and club, etc.
*   **Success criteria**: A R^2 of greater than 80% to measure the performance of the transfer market value prediction model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the web application.

If you want to know more, this is a list of selected starting points:

* [FIFA18 Complete Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset)
* [FIFA Offical Website](https://www.easports.com/fifa)


### 3. Business Impact

*   Create latent attributes to evaluate players
*   Model to predict player transfer value
*   Assist club manager to gain negotiation power
*   Offer wise transfer fee

    *   README.md to instruct developer set up configuration
8.	Project Management
    *   Experience three key roles in data science project: Project Manager, Developer, and QA.
    *   Using Pivotal Tracker to do project management

### 5. Dataset

1.	Player Attribute Data
    *   Ball control
    *   Crossing
    *   etc
2.	Player Personal Data
    *   Age
    *   Potential
    *   etc
3.	Player Playing Position Data
    *   Preferred Position
    *   etc


### 6. Scope

The NU student group will complete the items outlined in Project Deliverables. The NU student group will review and analyze PVP play data in Destiny 2 extracted through Destiny 2 API. Additional information such as PVE, player geographical, or any other data that is considered irrelevant for the analysis will not be considered.

The NU student group will perform analysis of data using appropriate analytical techniques, present the findings in reports and presentations, and provide recommendations on how the players’ data is clustered and labeled in team-level. The NU student group will provide an analysis and model to facilitate future analysis that incorporates all relevant data sets. 

### 7. Timeline

**Winter Quarter** (Jan 10, 2018 – March 24, 2018) 
*   Review and confirm project scope and problems
*   EDA and identify the data sources for analysis
